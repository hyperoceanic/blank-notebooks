# Blank Notebooks

Blank notebooks for Remarkable Paper Pro.

These small, single section notebooks are intended for single purpose, in contrast with the larger multi section notebooks which emulate the bullet-journal style. I tend to have one on the go for each project or client.

## Common Features

Every different kind of notebook features

* Colored title page with space for you to write the notebook book title and another space lower down for eg dates
* 100 pages for your work
* multi-page table of contents (TOC)
* Left and Right numbering on the TOC
* There's a link back to the apprpriate line in the TOC at the bottom of every work page.

## Lined Pages Notebook

This notebook has a hundred pages, with a table of contents linked to each. This is my main 'workhorse' notebook and I use it for most things, including projects and meetings.

## Folder and Files Naming Convention

In the repository, the documents are arranged in folders, according to device and handedness. Within there, each file name has the following meaning
* Page Style (of the content pages - Lined, blank, grid etc)
* Line spacing (Narrow, Medium, Wide)
* Color Name - the 'P' suffix means the color is borrowed from the color of the RMPP pen 'H' means highlighter.
* Orientation. Portrait / Landscape
* Revision - currently 'a'. You'll be able to track what version of the template you have.
